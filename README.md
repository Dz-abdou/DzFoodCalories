DzFoodCalories is an Android application made for a School project with java that uses a machine learning model created with TensorFlow Lite to help classify foods based on pictures. The app allows users to take a photo of a food item and receive a classification of what type of food it is and the nutritional values of that food. The app is designed to be user-friendly and provides quick food classification results.
